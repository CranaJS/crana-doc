As soon as you bootstrap a new project, you will have an application running with:

* Node.js backend
* React.js frontend

Under the hood it uses Webpack, Babel, ESLint and StyleLint with a few other plugins enabling a powerful development workflow, such as server live reload with nodemon and more. All preconfigured out of the box, so that you can focus on the important stuff!
